# Transitioning to KX Products: Creating a Bid-Ask Spread Density Plot üìà

This post continues from my previous write-up: [Building OHLCV Datasets & Candlestick Charts üïØÔ∏è](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/transitioning-kx-products-building-ohlcv-datasets-charts-fabio-gaiera-hozzf)

Today, we‚Äôre diving into more complex queries and arithmetic operations in **kdb+**.  
Until now, we‚Äôve focused on selections and simple aggregations within a single table. But what happens when we need to correlate data across **multiple tables**? If you're familiar with SQL, you might recall operators like `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`,`RIGHT JOIN`, and so on. In the world of **Trades** and **Quotes** data, we introduce a particularly powerful concept: the **AS-OF JOIN** operator.

## üîç What is an AS-OF JOIN?

An **AS-OF JOIN** matches rows from two tables based on the closest **preceding (or equal)** timestamp ‚Äî **not** an exact match.

### In simpler terms:

- For each row in the **left** table (e.g., `Trades`), it finds the most recent row in the **right** table (e.g., `Quotes`) with a timestamp **less than or equal to** the trade's timestamp.  
- Think of it as a ‚Äúnearest earlier timestamp‚Äù join.

## üß† Why use AS-OF JOIN for Trades and Quotes?

- **Trades** occur at specific, discrete timestamps.  
- **Quotes** continuously update bid and ask prices at different timestamps.  
- To analyze market conditions at the time of a trade, we want to pair each trade with the **most recent quote**  
  available at or before that timestamp.  
- Because quotes update asynchronously, **exact timestamp matches are rare** ‚Äî which is why AS-OF JOIN is essential.

## üÜö How does it differ from a standard JOIN?

| Standard JOIN                  | AS-OF JOIN                              |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Requires exact timestamp match | Finds the most recent earlier timestamp |

## üõ†Ô∏è Where is the AS-OF JOIN operator available?

Most **RDBMS** and **NoSQL** systems do not offer native AS-OF JOIN functionality. However, **kdb+**, **ClickHouse**, and **QuestDB** provide built-in support for it.

## üß™ Example: AS-OF JOIN between Trades and Quotes

### Trades (1 row)

| timestamp           | sym  | price  | size |
|---------------------|------|--------|------|
| 2025-08-07 10:00:06 | AAPL | 200.75 | 150  |

### Quotes (3 rows)

| timestamp           | sym  | bid_price | bid_size | ask_price | ask_size |
|---------------------|------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 2025-08-07 10:00:01 | AAPL | 200.40    | 300      | 200.60    | 250      |
| 2025-08-07 10:00:05 | AAPL | 200.65    | 320      | 200.85    | 270      |
| 2025-08-07 10:00:08 | AAPL | 200.90    | 310      | 201.10    | 290      |

### AS-OF JOIN Result (1 row)

We look for the quote with the **latest timestamp ‚â§ 2025-08-07 10:00:06**. That would be the quote at **10:00:05**.

| trade_timestamp     | sym  | trade_price | trade_size | quote_timestamp     | bid_price | bid_size | ask_price | ask_size |
|---------------------|------|-------------|------------|---------------------|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 2025-08-07 10:00:06 | AAPL | 200.75      | 150        | 2025-08-07 10:00:05 | 200.65    | 320      | 200.85    | 270      |

## ü§î How can I use the TAQ dataset?

Having created the TAQ (Trades And Quotes) dataset using the AS-OF JOIN, what's next? In this article, our aim is to calculate the bid-ask spread throughout a day.  
We won't enter into technical details of what the bid-ask spread is (there are several types of spreads), but briefly, I can tell you that Quant Traders care about the Bid-Ask spread since it has impacts on:

1. Trading costs  
2. Execution quality  
3. Strategy profitability

üîº High Bid-Ask Spread

- The gap between bid and ask is large  
- Example: Bid = $10.00, Ask = $10.50 ‚Üí Spread = $0.50

üîç What it means:

- Low liquidity (fewer buyers and sellers)  
- Higher uncertainty or volatility  
- Wider price disagreement between participants  
- Common in illiquid stocks, after-hours trading, or during market stress

üí• Impact on trades:

- Higher trading cost (you pay more to buy / get less when selling)  
- Harder to enter/exit positions without price impact  
- Bad for high-frequency or short-term strategies  
- May require limit orders to avoid overpaying

üîΩ Low Bid-Ask Spread

- The gap between bid and ask is small  
- Example: Bid = $10.00, Ask = $10.01 ‚Üí Spread = $0.01

üîç What it means:

- High liquidity  
- Tighter competition among buyers/sellers  
- Common in large-cap stocks, ETFs, and active markets

üí• Impact on trades:

- Lower trading cost  
- Easier to execute large or frequent trades  
- Ideal for algo trading, scalping, market making  
- Better price transparency and execution quality

### Building the TAQ dataset

The key part of this code is to understand how the AS-OF JOIN works. With kdb+ we simply do:

```
taq: aj[`sym`timestamp;trades;quotes]
```

Once we obtain the TAQ dataset, we proceed with arithmetic operations to calculate the (effective) bid-ask spread:

```
taq: update mid_price: (bid_price + ask_price) % 2 from taq

taq: update bid_ask_spread: 2 * (abs(price - mid_price) % mid_price) * 100 from taq
```

Beautiful, isn‚Äôt it? Getting comfortable with the terseness of kdb+?  
Using PyKX instead (AS-OF JOIN followed by arithmetic to calculate bid-ask spread):

```
taq_table = kx.q.aj(kx.SymbolVector(['sym', 'timestamp']), filtered_trades, filtered_quotes_keyed)

taq_table = taq_table.update(kx.Column('mid_price', value=((kx.Column('bid_price') + kx.Column('ask_price')) / 2)))

taq_table = taq_table.update(kx.Column('bid_ask_spread', value=((2 * abs(kx.Column('price') - kx.Column('mid_price'))) / kx.Column('mid_price')) * 100))
```

Now, let‚Äôs jump to the graphical stuff!

### Building the Bid-Ask Spread Density Plot

We're going to plot the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) of the **bid_ask_spread** column from the TAQ dataset.

- The X-axis, labeled Effective Bid-Ask Spread, represents the trading cost ‚Äî in other words, the difference between the price buyers are willing to pay (bid) and the price sellers are asking for (ask).  
- The Y-axis, labeled Density, indicates how frequently each spread value occurs in the dataset. Higher peaks mean that the corresponding spread value is more common among the observed trades.
